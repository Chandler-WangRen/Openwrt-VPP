# Openwrt-VPP
This project integrates VPP into OpenWRT, enabling OpenWRT to have the high-performance forwarding capability of VPP. It can achieve a forwarding capability of up to 10Gbps with a single CPU thread in large packet scenarios. It supports both virtual machines and physical hardware.

I have made it running, and it now support pppoe/nat/insecure vpn/frrã€‚but I still need some time to test it. It will soon come.
If somebody are interesting the project, please send me email warren_ren@qq.com and tell me what feature you want mostly, so I can adjust your plan.
